# AI LABS Project

Welcome to my AI LABS Project repository! This project is focused on solving classic problems through the implementation of algorithms in Python. Our main objective is to develop practical solutions to the following aims.

## Project Aims

### 1. Water Jug Problem Simulator

The first aim of this project is to develop a Python program that simulates the Water Jug Problem. This problem involves two jugs with different capacities and the goal is to measure out a specific amount of water using these jugs. This simulation will help understand the application of problem-solving techniques in AI.

### 2. Tic Tac Toe Game for Man vs. Machine

The second aim is to create a Python program that simulates a Tic Tac Toe game where a human player can play against the computer. The focus is on implementing an intelligent algorithm that showcases the basic principles of game theory and AI strategy.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Python installed on your system. The projects have been developed with Python 3.8, but they should be compatible with most Python 3.x versions.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of the command line interface (CLI) for running the programs
