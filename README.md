# AI LABS Project

Welcome to my AI LABS Project repository! This project is focused on solving classic problems through the implementation of algorithms in Python. Our main objective is to develop practical solutions to the following aims.

## Project Aims

### 1. Water Jug Problem Simulator

The first aim of this project is to develop a Python program that simulates the Water Jug Problem. This problem involves two jugs with different capacities and the goal is to measure out a specific amount of water using these jugs. This simulation will help understand the application of problem-solving techniques in AI.

### 2. Tic Tac Toe Game for Man vs. Machine

The second aim is to create a Python program that simulates a Tic Tac Toe game where a human player can play against the computer. The focus is on implementing an intelligent algorithm that showcases the basic principles of game theory and AI strategy.

### 3. 8 Puzzle Problem 
The third aim of the AI LABS Project is to develop a Python program capable of solving the 8 Puzzle Problem using both Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms. This aim will demonstrate the application of classic search algorithms in solving a problem that is a staple in the study of AI and computational problem-solving.

### 4. 8 Puzzle Problem using A* Algorithm
The fourth aim of the AI LABS Project is to extend the capabilities of the Python program developed in the third aim by implementing the A* algorithm to solve the 8 Puzzle Problem. A* is a heuristic search algorithm that efficiently finds the shortest path to a goal state by using a combination of the actual cost to reach a node and an estimate of the cost from the current node to the goal

### 5. Tic Tac Toe Game using Min-Max Algorithm
The fifth aim of the AI LABS Project Develop a Python program that simulates a Tic Tac Toe game where the human player can compete against the computer, which uses the Minimax algorithm to make its moves. The Minimax algorithm is a decision rule for minimizing the possible loss for a worst-case scenario. When dealing with gains, it is known as "maximin"â€”to maximize the minimum gain.

### 6. IDDFS for route finding on Romania Map
Create a Python program that solves route-finding problems on the Romania map (a common example in AI textbooks) using the Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) algorithm. This problem involves finding a path from one city to another.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Python installed on your system. The projects have been developed with Python 3.8, but they should be compatible with most Python 3.x versions.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of the command line interface (CLI) for running the programs
